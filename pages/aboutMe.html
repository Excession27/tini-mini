            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>Hello everyone. I'm Siniša Muratović - Sina. I'm the marionettes' puppeteer/puppetist/marionettist. A puppeteer is a person who plays a puppet/doll as a profession. The puppeteer of a puppet is called a puppetist/marionettist. My puppets/dolls are mostly marionettes.
                I love fantasy. My whole life is a fantasy. In the fantasy world I am happy and I feel safe. The time and space for play and music is very important to me.
                
                How it started?
                
                My view of puppetry is a long journey through a world of illusions, spells and wonders. I came into this world in 1995 when I met a man who taught me how to make dolls and also make animations. Not one bit easy, but a very beautiful, creative and magical craft with which the doll animator, through movement and word, brings the dolls to life.
                Puppetry - puppet show is an art that fascinates.
                In the beginning I made the puppets myself. Nowadays I have help, mostly from professional designers.
                
                With my theater I want to show the children and adults how nice it is to be creative, but especially to be a child again. During my performance I want to let others experience the magic of puppetry like I did when I was a little boy myself.
                
                Complete your party with lots of laughter and unforgettable magical moments brought through a doll and fantasy world. Invite me to make our fairy tale together that will stay with us for a long time to come.
                
                I would like to: make you laugh, make you move, maybe shed a tear, connect with dolls, who are really alive at that moment, experience an exciting adventure, above all let them enjoy the time and for a moment forget about the world around you.</p>
